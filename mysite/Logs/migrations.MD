## Activating Models

```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions
Running migrations:
  No migrations to apply.
  Your models in app(s): 'polls' have changes that are not yet reflected in a migration, and so won't be applied.
  Run 'manage.py makemigrations' to make new migrations, and then re-run 'manage.py migrate' to apply them.
```

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations polls
Migrations for 'polls':
  polls/migrations/0001_initial.py
    + Create model Question
    + Create model Choice
```

By running makemigrations, you’re telling Django that you’ve made some changes to your models (in this case, you’ve made new ones) and that you’d like the changes to be stored as a migration.

Migrations are how Django stores changes to your models (and thus your database schema) - they’re files on disk. You can read the migration for your new model if you like; it’s the file `polls/migrations/0001_initial.py.`

```bash
python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001
BEGIN;
--
-- Create model Question
--
CREATE TABLE "polls_question" ("id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, "question_text" varchar(200) NOT NULL, "pub_date" datetime NOT NULL);
--
-- Create model Choice
--
CREATE TABLE "polls_choice" ("id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, "choice_text" varchar(200) NOT NULL, "votes" integer NOT NULL, "question_id" bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES "polls_question" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED);
CREATE INDEX "polls_choice_question_id_c5b4b260" ON "polls_choice" ("question_id");
COMMIT;
```

The sqlmigrate command takes migration names and returns their SQL,
Now, run migrate again to create those model tables in your database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, polls, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying polls.0001_initial... OK
```
